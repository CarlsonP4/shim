Known bugs:

1. Shim does not work with plugins that require client load of plugin.so.
   The best example of this is timeseries. I'm not sure how to write a SciDB
   client that can use the pluginManager correctly...

Things to do soon:

* Add a signal handler to clean up temporary files and disconnect clients
  on SIGTERM before exiting.
* Work out a basic control API (some prototypes are in the code but not
  enabled).
